#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development. It involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications efficiently and cost-effectively. Software engineering ensures that software is reliable, scalable, and meets user requirements.

Importance in the Technology Industry:
Ensures Quality – Software engineering practices help build high-quality software that is maintainable and efficient.
Enhances Productivity – Following structured methodologies improves development speed and reduces errors.
Cost-Effectiveness – Proper engineering practices reduce maintenance costs and the likelihood of project failure.
Scalability and Security – Well-engineered software can grow with user demand and protect sensitive data.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The term "software engineering" was first introduced at a NATO conference to address the "software crisis," where projects frequently failed due to lack of structure.
The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s) – OOP introduced reusable code structures, such as classes and objects, making software development more modular and scalable.
Agile Methodology (2001) – The Agile Manifesto emphasized iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability over rigid planning, transforming software development practices.


The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of the following phases:

Requirement Analysis – Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements to define the scope of the project.

Planning – Estimating time, resources, and costs, creating a project roadmap, and identifying risks.

Design – Creating system architecture, database design, and technical specifications based on the requirements.

Implementation (Coding) – Writing the actual code using programming languages and frameworks.

Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs, verifying functionality, and ensuring software quality through unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.

Deployment – Releasing the software to users in a production environment, either all at once or in stages.

Maintenance – Providing updates, fixing issues, and improving functionality based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Feature	Waterfall	Agile
Approach	Linear, sequential	Iterative, flexible
Changes	Hard to accommodate	Easily adaptable
Testing	Done after development	Continuous throughout development
Use Cases	Large projects with fixed requirements (e.g., medical software)	Dynamic projects with changing needs (e.g., web applications)
Examples:

Waterfall is best for regulatory-compliant systems (e.g., banking software) where requirements are fixed.
Agile is best for evolving products (e.g., mobile apps) where features may change based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer – Writes and maintains code, implements algorithms, and integrates software components.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests software for bugs and ensures it meets requirements before deployment.
Project Manager – Oversees project timelines, resources, and communication between teams.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) help streamline coding with features like syntax highlighting and debugging.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IntelliJ, Eclipse
Version Control Systems (VCS) allow tracking and collaboration on code changes.
Examples: Git (GitHub, GitLab), SVN

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Code Bugs and Errors → Use debugging tools, test-driven development (TDD).
Scope Creep (Changing Requirements) → Use Agile methodologies, clear requirement documentation.
Tight Deadlines → Follow structured planning, use automation for repetitive tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing – Tests individual functions or components.
Integration Testing – Ensures modules work together.
System Testing – Validates the entire software system.
Acceptance Testing – Confirms the software meets user requirements before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective input prompts to achieve the best possible responses from AI models. It is essential for improving AI interactions, ensuring accurate outputs, and optimizing workflows.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about software."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the role of software in modern business operations, highlighting key applications in finance, healthcare, and e-commerce."
